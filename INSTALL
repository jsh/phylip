The PHYLIP build assumes you are using GNU make.

The default build should just work if you type "make".
For other things you can build from this distribution, type "make help"

To change the default options for the build,
or create a build for a new kind of system,
you will need to modify system.mk.
Notes on how to do that can be found in Note.customize-build

The compressed tar archive phylip.tar.Z when uncompressed and extracted
puts the source code into a directory ./src, and also makes two other
directories ./exe and ./doc for the final executables and the documentation
files.

If you want something different from that structure, change EXEDIR.
